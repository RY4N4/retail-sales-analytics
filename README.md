# 🛒 Retail Sales Analytics & Demand Forecasting

## 📌 Overview
This project is an **end-to-end retail sales analytics solution** that analyzes historical sales data to uncover business insights and forecast future demand.

It demonstrates how a **Data Analyst / Business Intelligence professional** approaches real-world retail problems — from raw data to insights, dashboards, and predictive modeling — using industry-standard tools and structured workflows.

---

## 🎯 Business Objective
Retail teams often need answers to questions such as:
- Which products and regions generate the most revenue and profit?
- How do sales trends vary across time and geography?
- What products drive consistent performance?
- Can future demand be forecasted to support inventory planning?

This project addresses these questions through **data-driven analysis and forecasting**.

---

## 🧰 Tools & Technologies
- **Python**: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn  
- **SQL (analytical design)**: schema modeling & KPI logic  
- **Jupyter Notebook**: analysis and experimentation  
- **Tableau**: interactive dashboards and storytelling  
- **Machine Learning**: demand forecasting models  
- **Git & GitHub**: version control and collaboration

## 📓 Analysis Workflow
The analysis is implemented in a **single end-to-end Jupyter Notebook**:

### `01_end_to_end_sales_analysis.ipynb`
This notebook includes:
1. Data ingestion and profiling  
2. Data cleaning and feature engineering  
3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
4. Business insights and trend analysis  
5. Machine learning–based demand forecasting  

> The single-notebook approach was chosen for **clear storytelling and ease of review**.  
> The workflow can be modularized into multiple notebooks or production pipelines as the project scales.

## 🗄 SQL Layer (Analytical Design)
SQL files are included to demonstrate **data modeling and KPI logic** commonly used in BI systems.

### `schema.sql`
- Star-schema–style analytical design  
- Fact table for sales transactions  
- Dimension tables for product, customer, and region  

### `kpis.sql`
Includes queries for:
- Total revenue and profit  
- Profit margin  
- Top products by revenue  
- Regional performance analysis  

> SQL execution was handled via Python and BI tools; these files document analytical intent and structure.

## 📊 Dashboard
An interactive Tableau dashboard was created to visualize:
- Revenue and profit trends  
- Product-level performance  
- Regional sales distribution  
- Key business KPIs  

A dashboard snapshot is available in:

---

## 📈 Key Insights
- A small set of products contributes disproportionately to total revenue.
- Sales performance varies significantly by region, indicating localized demand patterns.
- Clear seasonal trends influence sales volume.
- Forecasting models provide actionable estimates for future demand planning.

---

## 🤖 Demand Forecasting
A machine learning model was built to:
- Learn historical sales patterns
- Forecast future revenue and demand
- Support inventory and business planning decisions

Forecast outputs are stored in:
